### Overview

Serena and Riley discussed the challenges of consolidating data from multiple sources to support weekly and quarterly business reviews, focusing on the limitations of the current Port Pro system and the need for a more dynamic dashboard solution. They explored the possibility of leveraging an Airtable integration to address data fragmentation and improve reporting accuracy while maintaining interim manual processes.

### Key Takeaways

*   The team decided to explore an Airtable integration to enhance dashboard capabilities and consolidate data from Port Pro and Metabase.
*   They agreed to continue using the current Port Pro system with manual adjustments for immediate meeting needs despite its data limitations.
*   The team planned to coordinate with Jeff, Doug, and relevant stakeholders to address data discrepancies such as missing pickup city information and incomplete load IDs.

### Next Steps

- [ ] **Riley Barrow**: Message Jeff to address the issues with bad load IDs and data discrepancies in Port Pro.
- [ ] **Riley Barrow**: Follow up with Doug on the Airtable migration progress and integration enhancements.
- [ ] **Serena Mehta**: Provide feedback on the communication and dashboard document to guide further improvements.
### Key Topics
*   **Reporting System Discrepancies and Data Fragmentation** Problem
    *   Serena explained that Texas data was being handled in Metabase while California and Arizona data were captured in Port Pro, resulting in fragmented data views.
    *   The limitations in each system led to challenges in presenting unified, automated reports for team meetings.
    
*   **Custom Report Limitations in Port Pro** Problem
    *   Serena demonstrated a custom report built with Jeff, which only supported a basic table view, restricting dynamic visualizations.
    *   The inability to edit or filter the report adequately highlighted the need for enhanced reporting capabilities.
    
*   **Consolidated vs. Segmented View Requirements** Idea
    *   A discussion was held on whether to keep data views segmented regionally (e.g., Texas vs. California) or consolidate them into a unified customer-level dashboard.
    *   Riley noted that while a consolidated view would be ideal for comprehensive quarterly reviews, present configurations necessitated separate views, alongside manual consolidations.
    
*   **Exploring Airtable Integration** Update
    *   Riley mentioned that Doug had recently built an Airtable connection, which is currently in a trial mode and not fully populated.
    *   Both agreed that the Airtable integration might offer more flexible dashboarding options compared to Port Pro, pending further development and testing.
    
*   **Data Field Issues and Inconsistencies** Problem
    *   The team identified missing or inconsistent fields such as the pickup city, weight data, and partial load IDs in Port Pro.
    *   These data gaps raised concerns about the reliability of automated reporting and were discussed as potential questions to be resolved with Jeff or Frank.
    
*   **Manual Data Intervention vs. Automation** Problem
    *   Serena described the current need to manually pull and backfill data (e.g., aligning BCO details from load IDs) to prepare reports for meetings.
    *   The discussion underscored an urgent need to transition towards an automated and consolidated dashboard solution.
    
*   **Next Steps and Action Items** Decision
    *   Riley committed to contacting Jeff regarding bad load IDs and to follow up with Doug on the progress of the Airtable integration.
    *   Serena agreed to provide feedback on the communication document shared by Riley, which is intended to complement the custom report.
    *   Both participants planned to monitor progress on enhancing the dashboard capabilities before the upcoming Tuesday meeting.
    
*   **Re-brainstorming Documentation Processes** Decision
    *   Serena mentioned upcoming re-brainstorming sessions on documentation processes for the commercial sales side.
    *   She indicated that this might involve additional meetings and coordination, and Riley may be looped in to provide support.

    **Riley Barrow:** Hey, serena.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** I'm on mute. Hey, how are you?
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Hey, I'm doing good. How are you?
    
    **Serena Mehta:** I'm good. Thank you for the time today. Essentially, like
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Court
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Pro, as you know, just came into the mix and we're kind of back to like semi square one. I think where we're where I'm thinking or where we go with this is like, okay, we have Apollo that does all handles all like Texas stuff. And like the dashboard that we're creating is very much in line with that in Metabase. But then there's a separate need for California data, which now is no longer captured in Metabase. So we need to like create a report in Port
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Pro.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** I. I was trying to play around with it. I again, like, maybe this is something where it's like I just threw time on and we can like talk through it. I also gave you access to this custom report that I like really quickly built out with Jeff on Friday, but where it's like sucking is one. I don't feel like Port Pro has all the data from conversations with Jeff. I think the reporting is very much constrained to a table look. But again, like, I'm not sure. I'm still like playing around and maybe like, if you're able to unlock different capabilities. But from my understanding is like, Jeff is even looking at like, should we be using something like airtable to like generate similar dashboards to what we were able to build in Metabase. So it more just comes from like that perspective of like, what is an easy solution
    
    **Riley Barrow:** in
    
    **Serena Mehta:** the now to like, even help run that weekly meeting of mine, but also give the commercial team the views and looks and needs to be able to like, action on business and be able to continually look at data without the manual pull. And like the Port Pro migration was making me revert to the Manual Pro poll, which is like, obviously not ideal.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah, got it. Makes sense. I actually just spoke with Jeff and he told me that Doug built a airtable connection last night. So I'm trying to get access to that.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Okay,
    
    **Riley Barrow:** I am in Port Pro. This is my first time logging in, so not super familiar with it and it looks like I only have access to that reporting. Yeah, that reports.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** So
    
    **Riley Barrow:** do you see
    
    **Serena Mehta:** custom reports in here or.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah, I see custom reports.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Okay, so because I
    
    **Riley Barrow:** made sure
    
    **Serena Mehta:** that yesterday you got access to like the features that I have essentially,
    
    **Riley Barrow:** so
    
    **Serena Mehta:** it allows us to build reporting. So I did. This is the one that Jeff and I built last week where kind of what Metabase does, we were just looking at like preliminary data. We need to Be pulling now where I don't see the ability to like create a custom report that is not just like a table poll. So maybe that is why this connection is really important. Like if you can see like even if I create a new report, it ends up just being.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** What are all these other like reports that are on there? This seem to be like charts and stuff. Let
    
    **Serena Mehta:** me
    
    **Riley Barrow:** see.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Yeah,
    
    **Riley Barrow:** like click that. Admin dash.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Admin dash.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah. Yeah.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** So I
    
    **Riley Barrow:** just
    
    **Serena Mehta:** don't fully understand. Because you still can't like update it. Like you can filter on it, you can't update it.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah, I see. So your custom report was trying to pull the last three months load details.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Yeah. Ideally we would want more but then there anyways right now like it's only Feb onwards. Really. Or like Jan onwards is
    
    **Riley Barrow:** the. Got it. So this is. Yeah, let's see. Is there a way to save the report?
    
    **Serena Mehta:** There's also this dashboards view, but we don't have access to it. So that could be something where like we have to get
    
    **Riley Barrow:** okay.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** In custom reporting.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Okay, cool. Let me, let me tag Jeff right now.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Yeah. Because what happened with yesterday's meeting is essentially like we just decided let's view them in silo. So I guess like where. I'd love to just brainstorm this a bit because you kind of know what I'm doing. We have Metabase, we have Port Pro. It's easy to look at it regionally on different views once we figure out Port Pro and how to present the data. But then when you look at it on a customer level, the data still fragmented. Right. Is that manual intervention to understand volumes in your opinion, something
    
    **Riley Barrow:** you don't
    
    **Serena Mehta:** think is necessary, like just to understand how volumes are fluctuating on a customer level? Or do you think it's like we could still just look at it regionally and see like okay, this its lane for California. Like this is the volume we hit last month. This is what it is this month or week over week, however you want to compare it. But like do you think that's sufficient enough for us to like understand commercially how the account is doing
    
    **Riley Barrow:** opposed to what was the first thing that you
    
    **Serena Mehta:** said? Like me pulling the raw data from Port Pro and from Metabase, putting it into my Excel sheet and just doing like a pivot off of it to like get the weekly monthly volumes.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** So what you're saying is the, the second option that you described, by just looking at it at the customer level, you're able to pull that information in Port Pro and you're wondering if that's good enough to get us what we need to be able to run that meeting. Opposed to you trying to do both with Metabase and Port Pro.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Sorry, let me explain this again. Sorry. So Port
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Pro,
    
    **Serena Mehta:** like, if I look at Port Pro, it would not. It would be on the regional, like, on the region level, right? Like only Texas. So it's like, it would be its, but it would only. Then I would only look at, like, the Texas volumes, then Meta Base would give me its, but the California and Arizona volumes. So it's
    
    **Riley Barrow:** like it was the other way around. Doesn't Port Pro.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Oh, sorry. It's the other way around. Sorry. Yeah,
    
    **Riley Barrow:** yeah, sorry.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Yeah, sorry. So it's like, is it okay if the data is fragmented and you're just looking at like, okay, how did ITS perform in California?
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Week over
    
    **Serena Mehta:** week or month over month? Like, is that sufficient enough?
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Because
    
    **Riley Barrow:** you're also working consolidated.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Because
    
    **Riley Barrow:** you're also working with ITS in Texas.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Yes.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Okay,
    
    **Serena Mehta:** I see. I just isn't doing Texas rate right now with us. I just gave them as a random example, just a friendly.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** I mean, from the customer's perspective, like, Navoya is just one client. So regardless of, like, where you're operating, I think it would be good to have them combined and not have them separated from, you know, region. But at the same time, ITS is a large brokerage. So, like, they're probably serving different customers in California and Texas, but I'm not sure. But I mean, yeah, I think it's better to combine them. Right? I mean, ideally that's what we want, but there is, you know, some work involved in doing that. Does Sammy, like, are you. When you're running your meetings, are you trying to say, like, are you trying to segment California and Texas from each other or.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Yeah, so
    
    **Riley Barrow:** this is
    
    **Serena Mehta:** where it gets a little
    
    **Riley Barrow:** confusing.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** So I look at volumes month over month by customer. So that is regardless of if it's Texas or California, Arizona. However, with. When we look at like, on. When we do, like, the qualitative part of it, you're talking about like, chr. And then you talk about like, chr, specifically the Coke example, which is only active in. In Texas. So it's like, qualitatively it gets broken down by region. However, like, on a larger level, it rolls up into, like just the shipper, however, where Sammy and JB kind of fell. Where, like yesterday their feedback was like, let's just view things separately. But then to me personally, it's like, okay, we can
    
    **Riley Barrow:** pull
    
    **Serena Mehta:** up the dashboard in Port Pro. We can pull it up in Meta Base, but I also feel like there has to be a view that consolidates it.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah. Which
    
    **Serena Mehta:** I think that is the manual part that I have to do while we figure out a solution. I just wanted your thoughts on it. You do think that we need a consolidator. Right? I could follow their guidance and not do it, but I feel like that's a big missing piece still.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah. I mean they're probably just saying that because that's what we have. Right.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** And
    
    **Riley Barrow:** that's what they want and like something is better than nothing. But. Yeah. I mean ideally when you're running like a quarterly business review with ITS or somebody that operates in both states, then you know, you have those metrics handy on what our performance is
    
    **Serena Mehta:** across
    
    **Riley Barrow:** the whole book of business and not just siloed into California. So yeah, I think that's important,
    
    **Serena Mehta:** but I think like. Yeah, so I agree. So I feel like for the meetings I have to have both views and then the joint view. But I
    
    **Riley Barrow:** think the
    
    **Serena Mehta:** immediate necessity for the meetings is like getting a report for in Port
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Pro
    
    **Serena Mehta:** that isn't a table. It's kind of the ask.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah. Yeah. I think until we can get this spun up, I. Yeah, I think just having. Having him separated and being able to do it is good. I just got access to Airtable, but
    
    **Serena Mehta:** he
    
    **Riley Barrow:** said it's not complete, which I can kind of tell. So he said I got a free trial set up yesterday. There's nothing really in there yet. Absolutely. Piecing together some integrations and I'll send you an email. So yeah, there's. There's nothing really in here yet. It looks like he has this load ID which does map or does it the. If
    
    **Serena Mehta:** there's an M. I think it does because the M1003. That's looks familiar.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Okay. Yeah. All right, let me, let me send Jeff this message real quick. I'll add you on here too. Like
    
    **Serena Mehta:** the other thing that's really interesting to me in this OR that's like a missing piece is one we don't have pick up like city, state as a field, which I thought was interesting. You just have pick up location and then the
    
    **Riley Barrow:** like
    
    **Serena Mehta:** we don't have like the bco. So for example, for me to like pull it up like I can look at it on a company level but if for example someone wants to look at it
    
    **Riley Barrow:** on
    
    **Serena Mehta:** a. Or like, like you know, one of the sub. Subsidiary like companies, that's still something that we're just like unable to do here.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Got it.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** But I, I guess like for now It. It is. You look at it on a company level and then
    
    **Riley Barrow:** it.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** And the other thing that Sami mentioned as, like, something to look into. But again, I don't. I don't know if we're able to do this in Port Pro because it's on a load level rather than a leg level, but maybe it's something we can build into. Meta Base was just like, the number of. I guess I have to look into this with Leslie or Frank, but like, just the number of legs per shift. So they're trying to target how many, like, legs are we doing per driver shift. Like
    
    **Riley Barrow:** revenue legs or total legs?
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Like
    
    **Riley Barrow:** the.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** I believe it's like the count of legs.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** So, like, with a. This is like one part about the terminology with Navoya where I get a little mixed up. It's like if you're bringing back an empty container to the port, is that. That's considered a leg, right?
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Yes. So in that
    
    **Riley Barrow:** case,
    
    **Serena Mehta:** it's a lot cleaner because you'll see, like, the same load ID attributed to, like, multiple rows because it's like each leg has, like, its own row. But that doesn't. That's not the case here in Port Probe.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Can you refresh and click Dashboard again on your side? I'm not getting anything. On mine,
    
    **Serena Mehta:** I am not either. But let me try logging out, because the other day that's what was needed.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Okay, I'll do the same. It.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Nam.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Okay. Yeah. I don't think we're. So this. This table is kind of useless, right? Because it's. I mean, what. What is this telling us? So
    
    **Serena Mehta:** we just. I, like, ended up pulling it in to that manual pull of mine, or at least the load id so you can understand, like, the count of loads, the customer, the load, pickup and delivery, like DCs or whatever. So based on that, I went in and did like, the backfilling of the, like, which BCO it was related to and things like that. So it. It provided it for, like, really preliminary manual pull,
    
    **Riley Barrow:** but
    
    **Serena Mehta:** it. So it does achieve that for me, which was my banded solutions. I just think there's a huge push on dashboarding. I just don't.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** So there's not a pickup city. Okay. There's a delivery.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** There's a delivery
    
    **Riley Barrow:** city. They
    
    **Serena Mehta:** don't have the pickup city.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Are you serious? Yep. Oh, my gosh. What are we doing?
    
    **Serena Mehta:** I know, but it feels like whenever I surface that, like, reporting's not good or something, it feels like I don't have a good solution. But it. It's not taken very positively. So I Need to figure out some solution by my meeting. Unfortunately.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** You run those meetings on Monday, right? On
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Tuesdays.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Tuesday. Okay.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Yeah. How
    
    **Riley Barrow:** can they not have pickup city? That's so frustrating. Maybe
    
    **Serena Mehta:** it's
    
    **Riley Barrow:** called something
    
    **Serena Mehta:** different. Pickup location or.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah. Origin maybe? Or
    
    **Serena Mehta:** no,
    
    **Riley Barrow:** no, I
    
    **Serena Mehta:** didn't see it. I like looked very hard.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** I mean, are these. Can we assume that these are all out of the port of Long beach or is that. Is that not right?
    
    **Serena Mehta:** That's not right because all of this is in drayage.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Interesting. I'm going to save this. Let me just try to refresh this one more time for Jeff. Hey, there we go. Nice. All
    
    **Serena Mehta:** right. Maybe mine will come through soon. Otherwise I'll
    
    **Riley Barrow:** jack
    
    **Serena Mehta:** if I don't see it.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** So
    
    **Serena Mehta:** this might be able to then kind of do what we want.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah, we'll. We'll
    
    **Serena Mehta:** play. Are we. Are we able to edit these? Sorry, I'm not able to check anything in mine. Oh, yay. Okay. It was like a separate field.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Cool.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** So if we add to
    
    **Riley Barrow:** my dashboard, We
    
    **Serena Mehta:** can filter.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah. So I don't know what this is. Dashboard slash seven days. Created loads. Okay. So.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** I wonder if I can make this.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** So add to my dashboard. My dashboard. Okay.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Can you edit that by any chance? Like with the three dots?
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah, let me see. No. So created loads. Okay, so it has a pickup location on here
    
    **Serena Mehta:** and
    
    **Riley Barrow:** a delivery location and a customer load type, route return. Okay, So let's see.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Oh, we have this. That's kind of cool. Daily average moves per driver. I see how helpful that is. Customer, Not a customer portal. Customer service.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Let me, let me see what I can do here. So sales ops,
    
    **Serena Mehta:** I guess we do have a load by customer. Like I think it like that's a no. I don't know. Oh, you can't even duplicate one because I was like, oh, could I have a side by side view?
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Just doing a little research here and gonna see what's possible. So. Yeah. So air table. It looks like he's got some sort of back end. It's pushing it here. So it doesn't really look like we can do
    
    **Serena Mehta:** that here. So does it make sense to like give them a day or two to like push it, pull it into air table and then we can like try to.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** I think, I mean, that would probably be the best. Like you didn't create any of these dashboards, did you?
    
    **Serena Mehta:** No, these are all existing ones. I only created that custom report that you saw.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Gotcha. Gotcha. Did you see. Did you see this that I put together on the communication?
    
    **Serena Mehta:** No, sorry. I Haven't had a chance to. Yesterday was a slog and a half, but I will take today.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah, yeah, Let me know your thoughts because I think this can help help complement your report too. And I think Sammy would really like it. This was his ask from me to try to get some of this data. So just take a look at it, see if you understand everything. I definitely need to refine it because I used AI to identify customers based on their email address. But I know that there's like Triumph Pay. Like that's not a customer, that's like a billing. Yeah, I think there are some other ones like these guys right here. I wasn't like confident that those were actual like customers. I think they might be like Doc schedulers or something. So yeah, just, just take a look at that because I want to create a dashboard for you using like the communication data that we have in front because I think that would be a nice touch. And then yeah, I just got Claude configured. I'm going to try to hook it up to Port Pro and I'm going to take these notes from this meeting and like use it to generate a prompt. And
    
    **Serena Mehta:** yeah, like what I'm wondering is as a hacky solution, and I was kind of in Claude as well was like, can we upload like the RAW data file and have it potentially build like a band aid like dashboard, if that makes sense.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I was, I was thinking that same thing. So like if we just went to. So yeah, maybe we just talk about this custom report here real
    
    **Serena Mehta:** quick and
    
    **Riley Barrow:** then worst case scenario I can just export it and try to build something for you. So we got load completed customer.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Yeah, and just to explain it. So I use load completed to just date stamp it so that, that's when we review the data. It's like of that day. So that's how I decide like the weekly data pull customer, you know, pick up pickup appointments, not really relevant delivery location, load type, not relevant. Pricing total ideally would be like for revenue purposes. But it's like do we like are we calculating it? I don't know how that, like how it's coming in and things like that. And then pick up location and delivery are being used to try to map to bcos.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah, it's like how are these, how are some of these empty? It's not good. It's only $178. So are these just like.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** That's kind of. That's what. So it's like I'm trying like that's kind of why I wasn't like leveraging the revenue data yet
    
    **Riley Barrow:** because it looks a little.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Then you have like a random FSC charge code. Like, it's like, weird.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah. There's like chassis.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Yeah.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Fuel surcharge. Yeah. We're
    
    **Serena Mehta:** just trying to
    
    **Riley Barrow:** like,
    
    **Serena Mehta:** solve my immediate problem on Monday.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Great. Well, yesterday it took like three hours.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** I'm sorry.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** No, it's okay. It's just, I think candidly, I think everyone wants to achieve something. I don't. I think it's like, just painful when you're the one, like, trying to piece it together for the meeting, but then it's obviously not the best outcome.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah. Yeah, I'm
    
    **Serena Mehta:** sorry. So I'm kind
    
    **Riley Barrow:** of like stuck
    
    **Serena Mehta:** in that. But here I have. Let me just quickly see if I can do it.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Need probably distance in there. Let's see what else. All right, so there's pricing total, and then there's paid amount. That's not good. And there's nothing there. Trailer route, route, Delivery location. All right, so I got load id completed. I don't know if we need completed it.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** We do because of just like the date filtering.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Okay. Completed customer pickup. Pickup.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Like, I don't use pickup at honestly, I like pick up appointment in this case.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Just because these titles for the pickup location are a little weird.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** More. Sorry, I just don't. I'm saying I don't use the pickup appointment one. Not the.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Oh, okay.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Yeah, Pick up appointment. Just because, like, you'll see the date. So I just view it as like, when we've successfully completed the load.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Okay, gotcha. And that's when the load's been marked delivered. Or is that
    
    **Serena Mehta:** when we
    
    **Riley Barrow:** invoice
    
    **Serena Mehta:** it delivered? Because sometimes you'll deal with like, reschedule things like that. So the cleanest one is to just look at like when it's been delivered successfully.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Gotcha.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Yeah.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Like, I can see this one. The appointment was for midnight on the 13th, but it was completed on the 17th.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Yeah. So
    
    **Riley Barrow:** like you
    
    **Serena Mehta:** revenue when it's completed, kind of
    
    **Riley Barrow:** rest, free day, load notes, load type, overweight, pickup number, payment date, reference number, current location. This will add weight in there. Okay, let's leave. That should be good. Let's save this.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** So annoying that you can expand this to the Seamus.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** It looks like weight is kind of worthless too.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Sorry, what is worth?
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Wait, it was just empty? Yeah, I'm just trying to think. It's like. Okay, so if we get this into air table and we're just replicating the same columns, like how much is that actually doing for us? I guess the Good part is, is that it's. But
    
    **Serena Mehta:** then on airtable, can't you create a dashboard?
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah, you can.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** I think that's why they're doing that.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yeah. But we could also just regularly schedule. Exports from here. But I think that. Yeah, I guess that's what they're trying to do with airtable. Yeah, I mean, there. There are more options with airtable for sure. But if the information's bad here in Port Pro, then not to say that it's bad, but it's just.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** It's just missing. It has
    
    **Riley Barrow:** gaps. Yeah, it's just like inconsistent and it's like a little frustrating. Maybe
    
    **Serena Mehta:** that's worth asking. Jeff is like, for example, like that load id. But like, why is data. Like, is it just not getting backfilled? Like, is that something our drivers have to manually enter? Like, what is the reason that some columns are missing data?
    
    **Riley Barrow:** You don't actually use Port Pro for your job, do you? Since it's primarily an ops.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Yeah, it's like a dispatch booking thing.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Okay. So. IMC logistics,
    
    **Serena Mehta:** I've
    
    **Riley Barrow:** noticed have.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** That was a spot load, so maybe that could be. I just know that by like knowing we don't have contract freight, but.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Gotcha. Yeah, it looks
    
    **Serena Mehta:** like these are
    
    **Riley Barrow:** missing one
    
    **Serena Mehta:** of the load IDs with Jeff. And just like, maybe we can ask. Sorry, because I don't. Yeah, like that one just be like, hey, why is this, like, showing, you know, delivery data?
    
    **Riley Barrow:** It doesn't let me copy though. Here,
    
    **Serena Mehta:** I can type it out. If not. Thank you.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** I think this is probably a four Frank question more than it is a Jeff question.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** I just know Jeff and Frank are like, speaking like actioning on Port Pro together.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** So
    
    **Serena Mehta:** I feel like
    
    **Riley Barrow:** we
    
    **Serena Mehta:** just keep like one point of contact. Might just be like, cleaner.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Okay, cool.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Especially on like a data side, I
    
    **Riley Barrow:** think.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** So I guess, like, for us, I think the next step is like, see how Doug does with the migration, can sync up with him tomorrow and like, if they. If they make any
    
    **Riley Barrow:** progress
    
    **Serena Mehta:** today
    
    **Riley Barrow:** and
    
    **Serena Mehta:** then we can like work to build a dashboard from there.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yep. Yeah, I'm gonna give it a. I'm gonna give it a try right now as well. So I'll let you know and then I'll message Jeff about these bad load IDs and then, yeah, I'll follow up tomorrow and show you what I can. What I can do as a potential solution. And then I'll talk with Doug too and see how his migration airtable is going. Thank
    
    **Serena Mehta:** you. I appreciate it. And then I'll
    
    **Riley Barrow:** give
    
    **Serena Mehta:** feedback on your document. I have it up, so.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Okay,
    
    **Serena Mehta:** so I'll do that and then just a heads up, like, we're re brainstorming documentation processes on this, like, commercial sales side. So got a bunch of asks from JV today. I'm just like docu. Like, you'll just see me maybe like start looping you in or like if I throw a time on your calendar, just like, move it around. But like, you might just be hearing from me a good amount over the next few days.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Okay, yeah, that's fine. All good. Happy to help. Thank
    
    **Serena Mehta:** you. And thank
    
    **Riley Barrow:** you for
    
    **Serena Mehta:** like, walking me, working with me on this. Like, I kind of was like, I think this is about all I can achieve in Port Pro. So it's like validating to know that's the case.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** And
    
    **Serena Mehta:** then like, you can help guide you and Jeff can help guide on the airtable side. So that will be helpful.
    
    **Riley Barrow:** Yep, yep. I'll. I'll help you out. Serena. Feel free to message me anytime.
    
    **Serena Mehta:** Thank you. And likewise. Thank you
